###Investigative Reporting for Radio
with Susanne Reber, CIR
 
Goal: 	The pitfalls and opportunities. What does the reporting process look like for investigative radio? What is Reveal looking for from local stations?
 
Who:	All participants
 
10:30 to 11:30
###Marketing and Branding
with Chris Nelson, Pyramid Communications

Goal: 	An outline for the creative brief that distills the words, values and ideals of the program, so that we can move forward with a brand identity for the project.
 
Why: 	It’s not the be-all and end-all, but branding matters. It can be great — The Planet Money podcast, for example, exists independent of, and complementary to, public radio programs like Morning Edition and This American Life. Or it can be terrible — Center for Public Integrity burned an enormous amount of money and goodwill by renaming its site “iWatch News” in 2011 before that name went down in flames.
 
Who:	
 
11:30 to 12:30
###Events and Engagement
with Mark Briggs?
 
Goal: 	A plan for how we will engage listeners before, during and after the release of each installment in our series. What do the events look like? How do we solicit public while we are reporting?
